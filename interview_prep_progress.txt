Warm-up:
1. 45 mins (bug took 15 mins)
2. 11 mins
3. 20 mins
4. 15 mins
Arrays:
5. 25 mins
6. 2 mins (not really, but forgot to check in on time at start)
Hashing:
7. 31 mins
8. 9 mins
Sorting:
9. 6 mins
10. 10 mins
Strings:
11. 15 mins
12. 19 mins (+ up to 24 mins to optimize for validation errors)
Greedy algorithms:
13. 10 mins (+9 mins to optimize for validation errors)
14. 28 mins
Recursion:
15. 135 mins (bunch of time spent to dabble with Long/Double/BigInteger, and also not building a 10GB string!)
Stacks and Queues:
16. 90 mins (was interrupted, problem was also started some time ago, but never finished)
Recursion:
17. 180~240 mins (not done yet, crossword puzzle word slots are hard to find and then properly enumerate!)
18. 75 mins (not done yet, a few test cases are timing out, despite that solution can do up to n=36 in reasonable time!)

stopped a problem at 1:29pm for work mtg
restarted problem at 2:55pm or even 3pm
